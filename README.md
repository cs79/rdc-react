### _A non-correlated cryptocurrency portfolio hedge_

## What is randomcoin?
randomcoin (RDC) is a token built on top of the Ethereum blockchain that offers cryptocurrency investors a non-correlated hedge to their token portfolios.  RDC is pegged to ether (ETH) at a random (bounded) rate, with programmatic and incentive-based mechanisms in place to defend the peg.

## How does it work?
Upon initial contract creation, the RDC contract will be in a "funding" state where investors can peg in to the contract.  Once a sufficient number of peg-in transactions have occured (or a minimum funding level of ETH is met), the contract moves to an "active" state and peg-out transactions can be made as well.

The rate at which any individual peg-in or peg-out transaction will be processed is a random number 

(describe random step ceiling + random step size for draw - price should basically be a random walk and will have a different EV on every draw, which is the point of the token)

### A note on correlation

The term "uncorrelated" here is used w.r.t. a portfolio based in ETH; if an investor is basing their portfolio in a fiat currency such as USD, RDC will be correlated with the ETH/USD exchange rate, though not in exactly the same manner in realization.  (Realized rates for RDC/USD via the RDC/ETH and ETH/USD pairs will not necessarily be at the expected 100/1 RDC/ETH rate.)

## How can I set this up to try it out?

The randomcoin application was built on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS) with the following dependencies:

* `Node` version [xxx]
* `Npm` version [xxx]
* `Truffle` version [xxx]
* `ganache-cli` version [xxx]
* `OpenZeppelin` version [xxx]
* `Chart.js` version 2.7.2
* `react-chartjs-2` version 2.7.4
* `MetaMask` version 4.9.3 (or another injected web3 instance; this application was only tested with Metamask)

### Installing Node Packages
(how to fetch these things assuming that packages.json is correct)

`npm i` will download everything in package.json file

[possibly keep the openzeppelin contracts in the repo even if i don't put the rest of the node packages on there]

### Installing MetaMask

`MetaMask` is provided as a browser extension; installation links for supported browsers can be found at https://metamask.io/

### Running the Tests

Once the dependencies (particularly `Truffle`, `ganache-cli`, and `OpenZeppelin`) have been properly installed in the project directory, Truffle can be used to run the contract tests by following these steps:

1) Open a terminal window in the project directory
2) Run the command `truffle develop` to start a Truffle development console session
3) Inside the Truffle development console, run the following commands:
    * `compile`: compile the project's smart contracts
    * `migrate --reset`: migrate the compiled contracts to the development chain (ganache-cli under the hood)
    * `test`: run the tests of the smart contract

### Running the Development Server

With the smart contract tests passing, you can run and interact with the smart contract on a development server by following these steps:

1) Open a second terminal window in the project directory
2) Run the command `npm run start`
3) If a web browser does not automatically load once the server is running, open your browser and go to `localhost:3000` (the default)

The frontend application should now be running in your web browser, connected to a deployed instance of the smart contract running on the development chain. You may need to restart the development chain running in the first terminal (with either `truffle develop --log` or `ganache-cli -l=8000000` if you would like to observe live logs of contract events) and re-migrate the contracts if you experience issues with the application.

In order to test the frontend functionality using MetaMask, copy the seed phrase from the development chain into the appropriate prompt at startup (for a clean install), or copy the first private key generated by the development chain into the private key field for a new account.  You will need to ensure that you are connected to the correct network in MetaMask in order to connect to the development chain being served by Truffle / ganache-cli.  Depending on which version of the development blockchain you are running, the port may be different; if the default `Localhost 8545` network provided in the MetaMask `Networks` dropdown list does not work, you may need to set up a new network connection by selecting `Custom RPC` in the menu and using `http:127.0.0.1:9545` as the `New RPC URL`.  (The version of Truffle used to develop this app defaults to using port `9545` when running `truffle develop`.)  If you are using a different development chain / port, set up your custom RPC accordingly.

### Interacting with the Application

The frontend provides some interactive graphics (which will be populated once transactions into/out of the randomcoin token have been made) along with some information on the state of the contract and the chain it is connected to.  Users are initially provided with at least two interactive fields which allow them to specify an amount of ether they would like to peg in to the contract, or an amount of randomcoin they would like to peg out. [ *** THIS SHOULD ONLY BE ACTIVE IF THEY HAVE AN RDC BALANCE *** ]

If the contract is in the "Liquidating" state, users will additionally be presented with a button which allows them to claim, if they wish, their equitable share of the ETH in the contract, proportional to their holdings of the randomcoin token.

Additionally, if the user is the contract owner, they will be presented with an additional control panel with buttons that allow them to unlock the transaction mutex (in an emergency situation where it has become stuck; this should not occur in practice due to the contract's use of `transfer` rather than `send`), and a button that allows them to force the Liquidation state.  (For testing purposes, there is also a button allowing the owner to force a block to be mined on the development chain.)

When using any of the functions which interact with the contract, such as transacting in or out of the randomcoin token, the user will be prompted to approve the transaction via MetaMask (or another injected web3 instance; the application was developed and tested using MetaMask).  Approved transactions which affect the contract state should have those changes reflected in the web frontend once they are accepted by the development chain.
